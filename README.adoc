= UPay: UPI API Wallet Technology Demonstrator

UPay intends to demonstrate an implementation of http://www.npci.org.in/UPI_Documents.aspx[UPI]

The canonical UPI API, specified by NPCI, uses XML over HTTPS. The API calls are asynchronous. The Request, Response are paired through a common transaction ID set by the originating point.

Thus our Protocol Buffer UPI implementation will use Bidirectional http://www.grpc.io/docs/tutorials/basic/go.html#bidirectional-streaming-rpc[streaming RPC].

NPCI implements this API by mapping the payloads into ISO8583 0200/210, payment request/response, messages and passing it through the existing the NPCI infrastructure.
